# Stagehand + Browserbase: Automated Job Application Agent

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: Automate job applications by discovering job listings and submitting applications with unique agent identifiers.
- Concurrent Processing: applies to multiple jobs in parallel with configurable concurrency limits based on Browserbase project settings.
- Dynamic Data Generation: generates unique agent IDs and email addresses for each application.
- File Upload Support: automatically uploads resume PDF from a remote URL during the application process.

## GLOSSARY

- agent: create an autonomous AI agent that can execute complex multi-step tasks
  Docs → https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/agent#what-is-agent
- act: perform UI actions from a prompt (click, type, fill forms)
  Docs → https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/act
- extract: extract structured data from web pages using natural language instructions
  Docs → https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/extract
- observe: analyze a page and return selectors or action plans before executing

- asyncio.Semaphore: concurrency control mechanism to limit parallel job applications based on project limits

## QUICKSTART

1. uv venv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. uvx install stagehand browserbase pydantic python-dotenv httpx
4. cp .env.example .env # Add your Browserbase API key and Project ID to .env (BROWSERBASE_API_KEY, BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID)
5. python main.py

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Fetches project concurrency limit from Browserbase (maxed at 5)
- Initializes main Stagehand session with Browserbase
- Displays live session link for monitoring
- Navigates to agent job board
- Clicks "View Jobs" button
- Extracts all job listings with titles and URLs using Pydantic schema validation
- Closes main session
- Creates asyncio.Semaphore for concurrency control
- Applies to all jobs in parallel (respecting concurrency limit)
- For each job application:
  - Generates unique agent ID and email
  - Navigates to job page
  - Clicks on specific job
  - Fills agent identifier field
  - Fills contact endpoint (email) field
  - Fills deployment region field
  - Uploads resume PDF from remote URL using httpx
  - Selects multi-region deployment option
  - Submits application
- Displays completion message when all applications are finished

## COMMON PITFALLS

- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via uvx install
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID and BROWSERBASE_API_KEY
- Concurrency limits: script automatically respects Browserbase project concurrency (capped at 5)
- Resume URL: ensure the resume URL (https://agent-job-board.vercel.app/Agent%20Resume.pdf) is accessible
- Job detection: verify that job listings are visible on the page and match expected structure
- Network issues: check internet connection and website accessibility
- Import errors: activate your virtual environment if you created one

## USE CASES

• Bulk job applications: Automate applying to multiple job postings simultaneously with unique credentials for each application.
• Agent deployment automation: Streamline the process of deploying multiple AI agents by automating the application and registration workflow.
• Testing & QA: Validate job application forms and workflows across multiple listings to ensure consistent functionality.
• Recruitment automation: Scale agent recruitment processes by programmatically submitting applications with generated identifiers.

## NEXT STEPS

• Add filtering: Implement job filtering by title keywords, location, or other criteria before applying.
• Error handling: Add retry logic for failed applications and better error reporting with job-specific logs.
• Resume customization: Support multiple resume versions or dynamic resume generation based on job requirements.
• Application tracking: Store application status, timestamps, and results in a database for tracking and follow-up.
• Rate limiting: Add delays between applications to avoid overwhelming the target system.
• Multi-site support: Extend to support multiple job boards with site-specific form field mappings.
